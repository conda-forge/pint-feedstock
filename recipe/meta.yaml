  summary: Operate and manipulate physical quantities in Python
  description: |
    Pint is a Python package to define, operate and manipulate physical
    quantities: the product of a numerical value and a unit of measurement.
    It allows arithmetic operations between them and conversions from and to
    different units. It is distributed with a comprehensive list of physical
    units, prefixes and constants. Due to its modular design, you can extend
    (or even rewrite!) the complete list without changing the source code.
    It supports a lot of numpy mathematical operations without monkey
    patching or wrapping numpy.
